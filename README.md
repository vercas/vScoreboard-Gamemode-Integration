vScoreboard-Gamemode-Integration
================================

Contains the public files used by vScoreboard to integrate with gamemodes.

Contributions
=============

Everyone is welcomed to contribute either with issues for bug reports or feature requests (for the whole scoreboard, not just the gamemode integration part) or with pull requests to the existing files.
How stuff generally works should be easily deductible from these code files.
For anything else, just ask using an issue.
